# MMSfx
A graphics based system for managing supermarket memberships, built with JavaFX

## About the Program
This was an assignment I submitted for 48024 Applications Programming at UTS. The assignment explored object-oriented design principles, graphical user interfaces, and the model-view-controller architecture. Producing the program involved writing in Java, FXML, and CSS.

## Features
- Multiple admin account support
- Add, remove, and update membership status
- Filter members by name/email
- Generate summaries for each membership
- Generate report for entire supermarket

Below are the default valid username/password combinations for logging into the application, although they are free to be modified as you desire:
